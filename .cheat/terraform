# instead of using the service account you can use your personal account provided you've
# authenticated with gcloud:
gcloud auth application-default login

# and exported the environment variable to the saved file (or but in bashrc):
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=~/.config/gcloud/application_default_credentials.json

# no need to setup custom variable now in terraform providers block, just region and project name will suffice.
# ensure to unset these variables as they'll take precedance:
- GOOGLE_CREDENTIALS
- GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON
- GCLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON
